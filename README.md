![image](/screenshot.png)

An ecommerce website for a fictional computer games company. A school assignment for my Higher Proffesional Degree in [Front End Development](https://www.noroff.no/en/studies/vocational-school/front-end-development) at [Noroff School of technology and digital media](https://www.noroff.no/en/).

## Description

This is the final submission of the cross course project. It started off as a design task and has been built uppon several times in different subjects. It uses local and session storage for wishlist and cart functionallity.

As the final task the website uses Wordpress as a headless CMS for the products.

## Built With

-   HTML & CSS
-   [ES Modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules)
-   [Wordpress Headless CMS](https://wordpress.org/) - Hosted on One.com

This is where you list how to get the project started. It typically just includes telling a person to clone the repo and then to install the dependencies e.g.

1. Clone the repo:
